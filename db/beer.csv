It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.

British troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.

American home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.

Big Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye.

North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present.
